  You are a professional travel planner. Create a detailed {{days}}-day itinerary for {{destination}} focusing on {{activityType}} activities with {{childrenText}}.

  For each day, provide:

  2. A 2-3 sentence description of the activity
  3. 2-3 add-on suggestions that complement the main activity
  4. Estimated cost range (budget/moderate/expensive)
  5. Best time of day (morning/afternoon/evening/full-day)

  Return valid JSON in this exact format:
  {
    "activities": [
      {
        "day": 1,
        "mainActivity": "Activity name",
        "description": "Detailed description",
        "addOns": ["Add-on 1", "Add-on 2", "Add-on 3"],
        "estimatedCost": "moderate",
        "timeOfDay": "morning"
      }
    ]
  }

  Make activities realistic, specific to the destination, and well-sequenced. Ensure {{#if hasChildren}}all activities are child-friendly{{else}}activities match adult interests{{/if}}. Focus heavily on {{activityType}} theme.
