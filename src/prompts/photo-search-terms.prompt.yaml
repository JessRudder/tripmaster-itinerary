  Generate optimal photo search terms for finding location-specific travel photos.

  Destination: {{destination}}
  Activity: {{activity}}
  Activity Type: {{activityType}}

  Create 1-2 specific search terms that would find relevant photos of this exact place/activity. The terms should be:
  1. Specific enough to show the actual destination/landmark
  2. Focus on the most recognizable or iconic aspect
  3. Be concise (1-3 words maximum per term)

  Examples of good terms:
  - "Eiffel Tower" (not "tower in Paris")
  - "Tokyo skyline" (not "urban cityscape Japan")
  - "Grand Canyon" (not "desert landscape Arizona")

  Respond with JSON:
  {
    "searchTerms": ["term1", "term2"],
    "shouldShowPhotos": true/false,
    "reasoning": "why these terms or why no photos"
  }
