# Weather Integration Documentation

## Overview
TripCraft now includes location-based weather information for all generated trip itineraries. Weather data is displayed prominently in both the main itinerary header and individual day cards to help users plan appropriately for their travels.

## Features Added

### Weather Data Structure
```typescript
interface WeatherData {
  temperature: number      // Temperature in Celsius
  condition: string       // Weather condition (Clear, Clouds, Rain, etc.)
  description: string     // Detailed description
  humidity: number        // Humidity percentage
  windSpeed: number      // Wind speed in km/h
  icon: string           // Weather emoji icon
}
```

### Weather Service (`lib/weather-service.ts`)
- **Mock Weather Generation**: Currently uses deterministic mock data based on destination name
- **Consistent Results**: Same destination always returns the same weather (for demo purposes)
- **Realistic Data**: Temperature, humidity, and wind speed within realistic ranges
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to default weather if service fails
- **API Ready**: Structured to easily integrate with real weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap, etc.)

### Weather Display Components

#### WeatherCard Component
- **Full Display**: Complete weather information with icons and details
- **Compact Display**: Minimal weather info for day cards
- **Visual Design**: Uses Phosphor icons and proper spacing
- **Responsive**: Works well on all screen sizes

#### Integration Points
1. **Main Itinerary Header**: Full weather card showing destination's current conditions
2. **Individual Day Cards**: Compact weather display for each day's activities
3. **Loading States**: Updated to indicate weather data fetching

### Weather in Trip Generation
- Weather data is fetched simultaneously with itinerary generation
- Same weather is applied to all days (realistic for short trips)
- Weather information is persisted with saved itineraries
- Regenerating trips fetches fresh weather data

## Usage in Components

### ItineraryDisplay
```tsx
{itinerary.weather && (
  <div className="mt-4">
    <h3 className="text-sm font-medium text-muted-foreground mb-2">Current Weather</h3>
    <WeatherCard weather={itinerary.weather} />
  </div>
)}
```

### DayCard
```tsx
{activity.weather && (
  <div>
    <h4 className="text-sm font-medium mb-2 text-foreground">Weather</h4>
    <WeatherCard weather={activity.weather} compact />
  </div>
)}
```

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Real Weather API Integration
To integrate with a real weather service:

1. **OpenWeatherMap Integration**:
```typescript
export const fetchWeatherData = async (destination: string): Promise<WeatherData> => {
  const API_KEY = process.env.VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${destination}&appid=${API_KEY}&units=metric`
  )
  const data = await response.json()
  
  return {
    temperature: data.main.temp,
    condition: data.weather[0].main,
    description: data.weather[0].description,
    humidity: data.main.humidity,
    windSpeed: data.wind.speed * 3.6, // Convert m/s to km/h
    icon: getWeatherIcon(data.weather[0].main)
  }
}
```

2. **Multi-Day Forecasts**: Fetch 7-day forecasts and assign different weather to each day
3. **Geocoding**: Convert destination names to coordinates for more accurate weather
4. **Seasonal Awareness**: Adjust expectations based on travel dates
5. **Weather Alerts**: Include any weather warnings or advisories

### Enhanced Weather Features
- **Weather-Based Activity Suggestions**: Modify recommendations based on conditions
- **Packing Recommendations**: Suggest clothing based on weather
- **Best Time Indicators**: Highlight optimal times for outdoor activities
- **Historical Weather**: Show typical weather patterns for the season
- **Weather Trends**: Multi-day forecast progression

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. User submits trip form
2. `generateItinerary()` calls `fetchWeatherData(destination)`
3. Weather data is added to both main itinerary and each day's activities
4. Weather components render the information with appropriate styling

### Error Handling
- Network failures gracefully fall back to pleasant default weather
- Missing weather data doesn't break the UI
- Console logging for debugging weather service issues

### Performance
- Weather fetching happens in parallel with itinerary generation
- Mock service includes realistic delays (500ms) to simulate API calls
- Single weather fetch per destination (not per day, for efficiency)

## Weather Icons Used
- ‚òÄÔ∏è Clear sky
- ‚õÖ Partly cloudy
- üåßÔ∏è Rain
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è Snow
- üå´Ô∏è Fog/Mist
- üå¶Ô∏è Drizzle
- ‚õàÔ∏è Thunderstorm
- üå§Ô∏è Default/unknown conditions

The weather integration enhances the travel planning experience by providing essential information that helps users prepare for their trips and set appropriate expectations for outdoor activities.
